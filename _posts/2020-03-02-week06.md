# Dissapearing Data

I think with this presentation the importance of preservation finally "sunk in" so to speak.
The presenter mentioned one point in particular that really stuck with me, that being that a large
portion of research documents from before the nineties are functionally gone forever.  With research it
is apparent how physical copies pale in comparison to how ubiquitous digital can be.  Especially with the nature
of these papers.  I imagine most research papers aren't something that take a particularly long time to read, or 
have that much value in a re-read once youve confirmed its validity, especially compared to something like a novel.
For that reason, youre much less likely to need your own copy in comparison to, again, a rtaditional novel.  This puts
them at great risk to be lost due to their simply not being many copies in the first place.

As for projects, I have some ideas, but nothing concrete yet.  I was excited when I found out Osu, a game I've been playing
for years, went open source recently.  I was less excited when I saw how fast paced it was, but it was still neat to look at
some of the inner workings.  Godot seems promissing now, as well as some of the other game related project smentioned by my classmates.
