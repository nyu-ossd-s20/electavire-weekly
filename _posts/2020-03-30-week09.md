# Getting Into It

Were now at the official point where it feels like I need to start contributing for real.
Theres no "can we really work on this" discussions going on with inkle now, weve decided, 
environments are up and running, contact has been made, we are go.  Can't help but feel a litte
nervous though.  With any project you come in contact with, theres no possible way you just "know"
how it works right off the bat, and its a little intimidating to try and dive in.  I know for a fact
I'll be glad to have done it once class is over.  The only way to get used to that feeling of intimidation
is to jsut keep conquering it over and over till its not so bad.  I suppose, at least.
