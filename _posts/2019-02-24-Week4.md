#Making it work for the "Computationally Challenged"

One of the ideas that stuck with me after our talk was that some of the software recommended wasn't really for 
Computer Science experts at all.  They exist more for bridging the gap between us and the "computationally challenged" 
as our speakers so kindly put it.  This is another example of me not yet understanding how to properly involve and
help others on a collaborative project, as I'm still used to holing myself up somewhere dark and doing it alone.

Its also a good reminder of why open source projects exist in the first place.  I've had a bad habit recently, 
especially as I get closer to job search time, to see some of these projects as a means to an end so to speak.  The end
being a bit on my resume that helps say "Look, I worked on open source, I know what I'm doing!".  But of course when I'm less
self centered I remember these projects exist because lots of like minded people saw what they believed to be a problem, and
set out to solve it.  I feel like thinking of it more that way in the future will help me motivate myself through the intimidating
process starting to contribute.
