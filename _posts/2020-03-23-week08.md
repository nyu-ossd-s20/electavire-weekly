# Godot is a No-Go

The big change of this week was realizing that as cool as it would have been, working on Godot 
isn't a realistic goal for group 7.  I think wanting to work on a game engine clouded my judgement a bit,
in hindsight it seems obvious but its just a bit too complicated to jump in over the next few weeks for our
projects.  looking at even some of the basic issues, the fix is probably simple, but getting to the point where 
we understand the architecture of the project well enough to implement that fix is another story.

We've now moved to inkly, and already made contact through their still somewhat active discord server.  The project
also seems to have its much more manageable and learnable size, so heres hoping were able to stick with inkly.
