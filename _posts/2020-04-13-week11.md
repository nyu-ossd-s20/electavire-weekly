# Starting... now?

This week we made our stand up report to the class, and as far as I can tell everything went pretty smoothly.
Now it feels like were in kind of an interesting position.  Theres been so much discussion in class about
preparing to contribute, contribution plans, how to communicate, and now were here.  We have all the tools we need, 
all thats left to it is to... start.  I guess what I'm trying to say now is that the class work seems as though its
hardly in class anymore, its just something you need to do yourself.  Id almost call this post week 10B rather than 11, 
because in some sense its the same lesson.  Theres no more preparation.  As the great profits of the modern age Shia Lebouf
and nike have told me so many time over, I need to just do it.
