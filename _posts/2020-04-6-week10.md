# STAND UP

This week was the week of the standups! or at least, it was originally intended to be, but we in group 7
didn't quite make it into the class period, so we go next week.  All of the necessary preparations and what
not happened at the same time as everyone else though, so I suppose its not much of a difference.  I think as 
we start really getting into contribution plans here and communicating with the dev group, I'm starting to appreciate
the importance of taking the class in the first place.  I knew I wanted to take it because I only know how to work
independently, and thats not very conducive to working in pretty much any environment out of schooling.  Its still
a little uncomfortable every time, trying to work things out in gorup format.  I think once the "fail state" if you could
call it that of making an unsuccessful contribution or not contributing enough affects someone other than me it psychs me out.
Good thing im getting over it now rather than later!
