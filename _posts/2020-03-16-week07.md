# Bit of a Shakeup

Now on spring break, coronavirus has obviously caused some sudden and unexpected changes to the 
flow of how we do things.  Using zoom for classes was a pretty big change in and of itself, but
the sudden "exodus" from the dorms and apartments as it were made it even harder to stay on schedule.
My group working on Godot had originally planned on meeting wednesday the 18th to figure out where to 
go next but that didn't end up happening.  In the course of about a day I went from "Everything fine ill
just stay in my apartment" to "Moms freaking out and wants me to come home right now" and my flight ended up on our
meeting day.  I suppose its a good lesson that plans are going to fall through and its important to be flexible. 
Admittedly, since I had to drop everything and move right away, Godot hasn't exactly been the first thing on my mind, 
but as I settle back in I'm looking forward to recovering some version of normalcy as things keep moving forward.
